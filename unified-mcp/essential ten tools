## 🗑️ What We Removed (10 tools)

These were removed because they're:
- Redundant (covered by other tools)
- Too specific/niche
- Rarely requested by users

**Removed:**
- get_ncaa_scoreboard (redundant with get_scoreboard)
- get_ncaa_rankings (redundant with get_rankings)
- get_game_player_stats (too specific)
- get_game_stats (covered by get_team_stats)
- get_play_by_play (too detailed/niche)
- get_player_stats (too specific)
- get_returning_production (niche stat)
- get_team_rankings (covered by get_rankings)
- get_team_talent (niche stat)
- get_venue_info (rarely asked)

**Note:** The handlers are still in the code, just not exposed to PaymeGPT. Can be re-enabled if needed.
